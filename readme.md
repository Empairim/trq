## why

Use twitch streaming as a way to show recruiters dev skills. But going on twitch
might not be too appealing for recruiters since it’s visually cluttered and
can’t use chat without logging in.

## solution

A page that only shows the dev's stream. If a recruiter happens to catch them
live, they can chat with the streamer without having to log in.
