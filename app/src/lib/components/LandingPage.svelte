		Ever thought of using twitch to show off your coding skills? You might already be doing it. What
		if you send a link to your stream in your job applications? How will you know recruiters visited
		your stream?
	</p>

	<p>
		trq (twitch recruit) lets you create a clean page of your twitch stream with relevant
		information. If recruiters catch u live, they can chat directly without logging in.

		(this is just a random idea while in the shower. donâ€™t know if this will help with your job
		search, but we are here to find out xD)
